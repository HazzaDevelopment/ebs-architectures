        <hr>
        <p>At the beginning of 2022, many parts of the world experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases. January and February
            were particularly challenging months, as the highly infectious Omicron variant of the virus spread rapidly,
            leading to a sharp increase in the number of new infections. Hospitals became overwhelmed with patients, and
            governments had to implement strict measures to slow the spread of the virus. However, as more people became
            vaccinated and booster shots were rolled out, the number of cases gradually began to decrease. By late
            February, many countries saw a significant drop in daily case numbers, giving some hope that the worst of
            the pandemic may be over. Nonetheless, the situation remains unpredictable, and people are still being
            encouraged to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and others.</p>

            Terrorism and transportation disruption are often interlinked, as terrorist attacks can cause significant
            disruption to transportation systems such as airports, train stations, and public transportation.
            The disruption can range from temporary delays to long-term closures, which can have serious economic,
            social, and security consequences. Some common methods of transportation disruption used by
            terrorists include bombings, hijackings, cyber-attacks, and sabotage. Governments and transportation
            authorities around the world have implemented various security measures to prevent terrorist attacks and
            minimize the impact of transportation disruption. These measures include increased surveillance, passenger
            screening, and emergency response planning. Despite these efforts, the threat of terrorism and
            transportation disruption remains a significant challenge for societies worldwide.

        <h2>Crime Statistics in Cardiff</h2>

        <hr>
        <p>
            In the UK, crime rates have shown a trend of increasing in April, followed by a tapering off in the
            following months. This may be due to factors such as increased free time among young people at the end of
            the academic year, and an uptick in travel-related crime during the Easter holiday. However, as the year
            progresses, crime rates tend to decrease due to factors such as increased police presence during the summer
            months and greater community involvement in crime prevention efforts. It is important for the government
            and law enforcement agencies to be aware of these seasonal fluctuations and implement appropriate measures
            to address them.

        <p>A Heatmap-Based Natural Disaster Warning System is an innovative tool that visually represents the potential
            risk levels of various natural disasters in a geographic area using color-coded heatmaps. By aggregating
            real-time data from multiple sources, such as meteorological agencies and geological surveys, this system
            identifies disaster-prone regions and assigns risk levels based on the likelihood and severity of events
            like hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, or wildfires. Users can easily understand and interpret the current
            and predicted risk levels, enabling them to make informed decisions about safety measures, evacuation
            planning, and resource allocation for emergency response.</p>
